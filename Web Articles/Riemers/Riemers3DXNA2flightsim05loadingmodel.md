# Importing 3D Models from file

The city is nice, but how are we supposed to draw an airplane into our scene? Would we have to program every single vertex of this object? Luckily, we can load models that have been saved to a file. In short: a Model is a structure that holds all necessary information to draw an object. It contains the position of all vertices, as well as the normal data, color info, and if needed, the texture coordinates. It stores its geometrical data in Vertexbuffers and indexbuffers, which we can simply load from the file.

But that is not all. A Model can contain multiple parts, describing one object. Imagine we would load a tank model from a file. This file could contain one part that describes the hull of the tank, another part that describes the turret, another one for the door and two more parts for each of the caterpillars. The Model stores all vertices in one big vertexbuffer, and each part of the model holds the indices that refer to vertices in the big vertexbuffer. The model stores all indexbuffers for all parts of the model after each other in one big indexbuffer. You can see these large buffers at the top right of the image below.

![Model Structure](https://github.com/simondarksidej/XNAGameStudio/raw/archive/Images/Riemers/3DXNA2-05Importing1.jpg?raw=true)

Each part of the model simply contains the data that indicates which part of the large indexbuffer belongs to the part.

To learn all about the structure of a Model, including ModelMeshes, ModelMeshParts and Bones, read Recipes 4-1 and 4-8.

Each part also contains an effect, and if applicable, the texture image that should be used for that part of the model. This way, you can let your graphics card draw the turret as a shiny reflective metal, and draw the caterpillars using another effect that uses a texture.

Enough theory, let’s see how this works in practice. We will be loading a spaceship into our scene, which you can download here. Download this file and import it to the Content entry of your Solution Explorer, the same way as you did with images! You should now have an asset called ‘xwing’.

Next, we’ll be assigning it to a Model variable, so add this to the top of the code:

```csharp
 Model xwingModel;
```

Next, we’ll be adding a small method, LoadModel, that loads a model asset into a Model variable:

```csharp
 private Model LoadModel(string assetName)
 {

    Model newModel = Content.Load<Model> (assetName);    return newModel;
}
```

The method takes in the name of the asset. It loads all Model data from the file into the newly created mod object, and returns this filled Model. For now, this method loads a Model exactly the same as you’ve been loading Textures.

This is already nice, but at this moment the Model will only contain a default effect. This means we have to copy our own effect into each part of the model, if we want to be able to specify how it should be drawn!

This is simply done by extending our LoadModel like this:

```csharp
 private Model LoadModel(string assetName)
 {

    Model newModel = Content.Load<Model> (assetName);    foreach (ModelMesh mesh in newModel.Meshes)
        foreach (ModelMeshPart meshPart in mesh.MeshParts)
            meshPart.Effect = effect.Clone();
    return newModel;
}
```

For each part of each mesh in our model, we store a copy of our own effect into the part. Now our model has been loaded and initialized completely!

Next, call this method from our LoadContent method to load the xwing into our Model variable:

```csharp
 xwingModel = LoadModel("xwing");
```

We’ve seen quite a lot of theory above, but luckily this did not result in a lot of difficult code. With our model loaded into our xwingModel variable, we can move on to the code that renders the Model.

To keep things clean, we’ll create a separate DrawModel method:

```csharp
 private void DrawModel()
 {
     Matrix worldMatrix = Matrix.CreateScale(0.0005f, 0.0005f, 0.0005f) * Matrix.CreateRotationY(MathHelper.Pi) * Matrix.CreateTranslation(new Vector3(19, 12, -5));

     Matrix[] xwingTransforms = new Matrix[xwingModel.Bones.Count];
     xwingModel.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTo(xwingTransforms);
     foreach (ModelMesh mesh in xwingModel.Meshes)
     {
         foreach (Effect currentEffect in mesh.Effects)
         {
             currentEffect.CurrentTechnique = currentEffect.Techniques["Colored"];
             currentEffect.Parameters["xWorld"].SetValue(xwingTransforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index] * worldMatrix);
             currentEffect.Parameters["xView"].SetValue(viewMatrix);
             currentEffect.Parameters["xProjection"].SetValue(projectionMatrix);
         }
         mesh.Draw();
     }
 }
```

This code has some important differences with the code that renders the city. First of all, you need a World matrix that is different from the Identity matrix. This is required, because when you would render the xwing immediately, you would notice 2 problems:

> The xwing would be WAY too large

It would be rotated for 180 degrees, with its nose into the positive Z direction, while XNA takes the negative Z direction as Forward

These problems can easily be compensate for, by rendering the xwing with a World matrix containing a scale-down operation as well as a rotation. Have a look at the definition of the World matrix: the model is scaled down with a factor 0.0005, making it 2000 times smaller! Furthermore, the model is rotated over Pi radians (Pi radians equal 180 degrees). Finally, the Model is moved to position (19,12,-5) in our 3D city, just in order to make sure it’s not inside a building.

The second difference is that you need to take the Bone matrices of the Model into account, so the different parts of the Model are rendered at their correct positions.

See Recipes 4-8 and 4-9 for more information about Bone matrices!

The remainder of the method configures the effect to render the Model. Since the vertices of our xwing only contain Color information, we’ll use the Colored technique to render it.

Don’t forget to call this method from within our Draw method:

```csharp
 protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
 {
     device.Clear(ClearOptions.Target | ClearOptions.DepthBuffer, Color.DarkSlateBlue, 1.0f, 0);

     DrawCity();
     DrawModel();

     base.Draw(gameTime);
 }
```

This should give you the final image:

That doesn’t look too realistic yet, because of the blue background and because we’re not yet using lighting. More on this in a few chapters!

> You can try these exercises to practice what you've learned:
>
> - Move the xwing to a different position
> - Set a different rotation and scaling before rendering the xwing
