Description:

This tutorial details several simple techniques for constraining motion and collision detection in two dimensions.

Tutorial Overview

Games don't need to be complex to be fun and interesting. Obstacle avoidance games consist of a character and some objects that are on a crash course towards each other. The player must avoid the oncoming objects.
