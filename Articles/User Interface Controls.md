Sample Overview

This sample builds on the GameStateManagement sample for Windows Phone 7, adding user interface elements with a look and feel similar to Windows Phone 7 Silverlight applications. These screens are designed to be easily added to an existing game, whether or not it already uses GameStateManagement.

Several controls are provided, including scrolling lists of text and images, as well as page flipping controls.
